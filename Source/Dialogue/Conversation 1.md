Asya'la: Do you have a minute?
 
  Player: Not right now.
    
    Asya'la: Oh... Okay.
  
  Player: Sure, what do you need?

    Asya'la: I just wanted to thank you for being my guide. I've seen so much of Skyrim already, it's more beautiful than I would have ever imagined. I may be a khajiit, but this is my homeland. I've never been to Elsweyr, while it is where my people are from, it is not where I am from. This journey has been something special.
    
      Player: It's been my pleasure having you along.
      
        Asya'la: You as well.
        (Continue to "You must have had an interesting upbringing.)
      
      Player: Sure, as long as I'm getting paid.
      
        Asya'la: Oh... yeah. Well let's be off then.
        (End conversation.)
      
      Player: You must have had an interesting upbringing.
      
        Asya'la: You could say that. The island I grew up on was called Kottheim. It's far north of Windhelm, travelers always noted on how cold it has. The Nords never noticed, I didn't either... althought I also have fur.
        
        Player: What were your parents like?
         
          Kottheim has a small port for the East Empire Company, sailor often layover there as the island is one of the only stops that far north. My 'da works as the dockmaster. His name is Vinvar, he's the one that found me when inspecting a merchant ship that had run aground. He always told me how he loved me from the moment he saw me, although I think that's a load of tosh. He met my 'ma back when he was a sailor, she was a crewmate on one of his voyages around High Rock, she settled down with him on Kottheim not long after they met. Her name is Fasta. I don't get alonga as well as I do with 'da, she was always so strict... put in retrospect I knew she just wanted what was best for me.
        
        Player: What was life on the island like?

          Asya'la: Much like it is here in Skyrim, but... older. Here in Skyrim the people have been Imperialized, even those "Skyrim for the Nords" types. On Kottheim we don't folow Kynareth or Arkay, we follow Kyne and Orkey. While I still respect the Mainlanders and this land, I cannot deny that the Nords here have lost parts of their culture that us islanders have not.

        Player: Did you have any friends?
        
          Asya'la: When I was a cub the other children didn't seem to fond of me. I was a cat, many of them had never seen one of my kind before. I did have one good friend though. Her name was Sif, she saw that past my fur I was just like any of the other children... I miss her dearly.
          
            Player: Did something happen to Sif?

              Asya'la: I... don't really want to talk about her right now.

(After all three topics have been exhausted.)

Asya'la: Well, we should really get moving. I enjoyed our chat.
