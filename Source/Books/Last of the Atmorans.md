Kottheim is an unassuming little isle in the Sea of Ghosts. The land is in a near-perpetual winter and rarely sees weather that is not snowfall. This place would be completely unremarkable, just another unimportant island, if it was not for the traditions that still survived amoungst its people.

The isle is one of the oldest continually habitated places in Tamriel. Nordic peoples have been known to live on there since the time of the Atmoran conqeusts. Legend holds that the inhabitants of Kotthiem trace their ancestry back to a one of Ysgramor's vessels that crashed and became marooned on the isle. From then until the mid-Third Era the native Kotts lived in isolated tribes and retained much of the old Atmoran beliefs. Worship of animal totems dedicated to gods such as Kyne and Jhunal were commonplace on the isle.

First contact with the larger world was made in 3E 274 during the conquests of Uriel V. When the warrior-emperor made landfall he saw potential for Kottheim to serve as a fortified port to protect his new interested in the north. Prior to moving his fleet onward to Cathnoquey, Uriel ordered the construction of Fort Nix and a small port nearby.

The presence of heavily-armed outsiders did not sit well with the native Kotts. In the years following the construction of Fort Nix many violent skirmishes broke out between the Imperials and Kotts. While the Imperial soldiers had better training and equipment their poor provisions kept them from completely defeating the natives. Likewise, the Kotts' extensive knowledge of the island aided them in keeping the Imperials at bay. Every conflict between the two groups ended in a stalemate.

After the reign of Uriel V a dedicated fort in the north was no longer deemed nesessary. Fort Nix was decomissioned and the majority of the Imperial garrison was pulled off the isle. A token force remained to maintain the port.
