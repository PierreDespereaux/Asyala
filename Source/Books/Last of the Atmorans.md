Kottheim is an unassuming little isle in the Sea of Ghosts. The land is in a near-perpetual winter and rarely sees weather that is not snowfall. This place would be completely unremarkable, just another unimportant island, if it was not for the traditions that still survived amoungst its people.

The isle is one of the oldest continually habitated places in Tamriel. Nordic peoples have been known to live on there since the time of the Atmoran conqeusts. Legend holds that the inhabitants of Kotthiem trace their ancestry back to a one of Ysgramor's vessels that crashed and became marooned on the isle. From then until the mid-Third Era the native Kotts lived in isolated tribes and retained much of the old Atmoran beliefs. Worship of animal totems dedicated to gods such as Kyne and Jhunal were commonplace on the isle.

First contact with the larger world was made in 3E 274 during the conquests of Uriel V. When the warrior-emperor made landfall he saw potential for Kottheim to serve as a fortified port to protect his new interested in the north. Prior to moving his fleet onward to Cathnoquey, Uriel ordered the construction of Fort Nix and a small port nearby.

The presence of heavily-armed outsiders did not sit well with the native Kotts. In the years following the construction of Fort Nix many violent skirmishes broke out between the Imperials and Kotts. While the Imperial soldiers had better training and equipment their poor provisions kept them from completely defeating the natives. Likewise, the Kotts' extensive knowledge of the island aided them in keeping the Imperials at bay. Every conflict between the two groups ended in a stalemate.

After the reign of Uriel V a dedicated fort in the north was no longer deemed nesessary. Fort Nix was decomissioned and the majority of the Imperial garrison was pulled off the isle. A token force remained to maintain the port, but it did not take long for the East Empire Company became interested. As it turned out, Kottheim was in the perfect location to serve as a layover point for merchants traveling straight from High Rock to Solstheim or Morrowind. The Company began to lease the port from the Empire and by the mid-third centuary the small militray port had become the town of Port Uriel. Every service a traveling mercahnt could want was present at the new there. 

With the departure of the Imperial military force peaceful interaction between the newcomers and the Kotts began. While some tribes rejected the newcomers many embraced  the new goods they brought to the island. Many Kotts found themselves moving to Port Uriel to improve their living conditions and find work with the Company. This marked the beginning of a cultural fissure between Kottheim's natives.

At the end of the Third Era the native Kotts had been cleanly divided into two distinct groups: The Company Kotts, those had left their tribal life behind to live in Port Uriel, and the Barrow Kotts, those who remained in their tribal land around Kottheim's single burial tomb, Balfour Barrow. While no real violence has ever erupted between the two Kotts, each group has great distain for the other.

Despite the marked difference between Company and Barrow Kotts their beliefs remain much the same, both still follow the old Nordic Pantheon. Despite centauries of Imperial influence, even the Company Kotts have resisted imperialization. This makes Kottheim quite unique in the eyes of anthropologists. The isle is the last major epicenter of Old Nordic traditions, much can be learned about the past simple by traveling to it. The traditions are as ancient as the land, animal totems dot the landscape, still being used, shrines to the Whale and Hawk can be found in otherwise Imperial-looking structures, and the locals speak in an accent quite distinct from any other Nord.

Kottheim is an undistrubed timecapsule of every Nord's past. It gives us a glimpse of what once was and possibly even shows us what the early Atmorans were like, but more than even the Skaal on Solstheim could. Despite the unassuming landsacpe, this isle is an invaluable source for Early Nordic historians.
