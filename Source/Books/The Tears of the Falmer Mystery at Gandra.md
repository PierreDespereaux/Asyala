The Tears of the Falmer\
Mystery at Gandra

by Amadeo Veccini, Imperial Geograohical Society

The Snow Elven ruin of Gandra was once a major monastery devoted to the god Auri-El in the late Merethic Era, located in what is now the Rift, Province of Skyrim. Home to monk-prelates and knight-paladins, the shrine was one of the last known bastions of the Snow Elves on the Skyrim mainland.

There is some speculation that the knight-paladins stationed at Gandra were charged with the protection of Tarn Alasil, a sacred garden some sources have marked as fairly near to Gandra’s location. However, this is purely theoretical, as is the existence of Tarn Alasil itself. It is more likely that the knight-paladins were simply present to guard the monastery and its prelates from harm.

At some point during the early Dragon War era, the Snow Elf purges ordered by the cult’s wartime leaders came to Gandra. Kriin, a high priest of the Council, marched on the monastery and laid siege, with the drawn-out standoff lasting for some time as the elves’ resources slowly dwindled.

Despite all odds the siege was broken and the Dragon Cult's army left in retreat. Kriin’s apprentice and eventual successor as councilor, Rahgot, returned to Bromjunaar to inform the High Council that Kriin had been killed in the assault and elves had triumphed. However, at the same time Gandra's own forces returned to the central Chantry of Auri-El with a much different report, their leader, Curate Laianstil, had fallen and they had been forced into a retreat with the Atmorans winning the day.

Scholars have puzzled over these events for several millennia in an attempt to make sense out of how both leaders fell and both armors reported back in defeat.

Following the mysterious turn of events, the Dragon Cult returned to Gandra to retrieve Kriin's body. The monastery was turned into the burial chamber Fjerdhim for Kriin and his forces to commemorate the place where they fell in battle.

My recent expedition to the Rift has revealed ruins similar to contemporary descriptions of Gandra high in the mountains of the Rift, entirely inaccessible by traditional means. However, a Nordic ruin has been discovered at the base of the mountain, seemingly constructed around a Falmer wayshrine likely used as the primary entrance to the Gandra complex. As of yet, however, no method of opening the wayshrine has been determined, and so the ruins of Gandra remain a purely theoretical topic.
